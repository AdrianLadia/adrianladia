Hey there! 👋

I'm a self-taught programmer with 5 years of experience. I started learning after college because I felt that in order for our family business to survive, we needed to use the power of the computer.

Currently, I'm working on developing an online shop for Paper Boy Manufacturing 🏭, where we produce various paper products. You can check out the website I'm working on here: https://starpack.ph. As part of my development journey, I'm learning React JS 🌱 and Firebase 🔥, which I'm super excited about! I'm also looking for collaborators 👯 to join me on this project, and I'm seeking help 🤔 with building eCommerce websites. 

In terms of my programming language knowledge, I'm proficient in Python 🐍 and JavaScript. For the GUI, I've used tkinter for Python and React JS for JavaScript. I've worked with various databases including SQLite, SQL Server, and Firestore. For the backend, I've used Python and Firebase.

In the past, I have also built Inventory Barcode Systems to help collect data and analyze it to give suggestions on what we should do with the business. It's an area that I'm passionate about and enjoy working on. If you have any questions about Data Science 💬, feel free to ask me.

When I'm not working on this project or other programming tasks, I like to de-stress by hanging out with my girlfriend, it helps me relax and recharge. Another way I like to unwind is by playing tennis 🎾 and Dota 2 🎮.
