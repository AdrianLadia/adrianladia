Hi there! 👋
I'm a self-taught software engineer with 6 years of experience, driven by the belief that technology can transform businesses. After college, I dove into programming to modernize our family business, and I haven’t looked back since.

Currently, I’m leading the development of a cloud-based accounting system ☁️📊 for our company, enabling real-time insights into business performance 📈. This project has sharpened my expertise in MongoDB 🛢️, Flask 🌐, handling concurrent transactions ⚙️, and leading a team of engineers 👨‍💻👩‍💻.

Prior to this, I developed an eCommerce platform for Paper Boy Manufacturing 🏭, where we produce a variety of paper products. I’m constantly learning, with React JS 🌱 and Firebase 🔥 being my latest tech stacks, and I’m excited about the possibilities they bring. I’m also open to collaborating on new projects 👯, especially in the eCommerce space.

🔑 Key Skills:

Languages: Python 🐍, JavaScript
Frameworks: Flask, React JS
Databases: MongoDB, SQLite, SQL Server, Firestore
Other: Built custom Inventory Barcode Systems for data-driven decision-making
Aside from coding, I’m passionate about data science 💬 and love discussing how we can use data to drive business outcomes. In my downtime, you’ll find me playing tennis 🎾, gaming 🎮 (Dota 2), or spending time with my girlfriend to recharge.

Feel free to connect if you’re interested in collaborating, or have any questions. You can reach me at ladia.adrian@gmail.com 📫.
